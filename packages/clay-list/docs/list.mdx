A list can composable by a Header, an Item and Quick Actions.

<List />

## QuickActionMenu

Use `QuickActionMenu` composition inside `Item` for defining a QuickActionMenu.

Wrap `QuickActionMenu.Item` inside `QuickActionMenu` for defining an `Item` of QuickActionMenu. See the following example:

<ListQuickActionsMenu />

## ClayList children

To ensure your html structure is accessible, make sure any children passed to `ClayList` are `li` elements. Both `ClayList.Item` and `ClayListHeader` are `li` elements.
