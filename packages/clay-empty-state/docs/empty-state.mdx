## Without Animation

By ommiting the `imgSrc` prop you will render a default Empty State component.
Even without an animation you can still pass in `children` to the component as seen with the `ClayButton` component in this example.

<EmptyState />

## With Animation

Adding an image to the component is easy, just point the `imgSrc` to the image you want to use

<EmptyStateWithImage />

## Reduced Motion

The CSS class `c-prefers-reduced-motion` forces the unanimated image to display. It bypasses the system's reduced motion setting. You can add this class on the `body` tag or a specific component's parent container to disable all animations and transitions.

The property `imgSrcReducedMotion` is used to provide an alternate image if a user has requested to minimize the amount of non-essential motion to use via the class `c-prefers-reduced-motion` or the operating system.

There is an accompanying property, `imgPropsReducedMotion`, where specific properties can be passed to the reduced motion `img` tag. If it is not defined, it uses the properties defined in `imgProps`.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-info">
	To see the system's reduce motion setting in action, refer to the example in
	the <a href="#with-animation">With Animation</a> section.
</div>

<EmptyStateReducedMotionWithImage />
