The Panel is a replacement for the old ClayCollapse in version 2.x, has the same effect but written in React using composition, try it. We recommend that you review the [use cases in the Storybook](https://storybook.clayui.com/?path=/story/design-system-components-panel--default).

## Basic Usage

<Panel />

## Usage with a custom Title

`ClayPanel.Title` allows you to add custom content to the title of the panel as seen in this example using `ClayLabels`.

<PanelWithCustomTitle />
