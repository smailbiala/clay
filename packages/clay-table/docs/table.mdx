## Composing

You compose the table with the main components to assemble a table with your use cases, use `ClayButton`, `ClayDropDown`... in the cells and try it out. We recommend that you review the [use cases in the Storybook](https://storybook.clayui.com/?path=/story/design-system-components-table--default).
