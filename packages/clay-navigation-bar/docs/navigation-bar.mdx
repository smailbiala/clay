As described on Lexicon, a NavigationBar can be styled with an inverted theme. It displays navigation items in a dark background with light text. It is always placed right below the header. Use [`inverted`](#api-inverted) property for this.

<NavigationBar />

Use the property `active` to specify which element is currently active on the navigation.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<code class="language-text">triggerLabel</code> property is mandatory
	because it specifies the name of the trigger of the dropdown that will be
	placed when the screen when on small screens.
</div>

## Item

For enabling more personalization on NavigationBar items, you can pass `<ClayNavigationBar.Item>` component to specify the element that will be rendered as an item. Components like `<ClayButton />` and `<ClayLink />` when added as children of the component item are not required to add unique classes like `nav-link` or set the `displayType` to `unstyled` this is set OOTB.

<NavigationBarWithStyledItem />
