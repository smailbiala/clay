## Introduction

Heading is a component that creates a title or a subject of an article or a pice of work. This a proposal created using the `h1` tag which you can modify the `weight` and the `level` of the component.

## Level

By default, the semantic of the heading level is level 1 in which the component will render as an `h1` element. However, if you need to change the semantic of the level, you just provide it using the `level` property from 1 to 6.

<HeadingLevel />

## Font Weights

In the same way, Heading component provides some styles depending on the `weight`. You can check them [here](/docs/css/utilities/markup-text.html#css-text-weights).
