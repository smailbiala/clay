## Introduction

Focus Trap is a component that wraps elements in the DOM and prevents focus from escaping from its child components when the user navigates with Tab or Shift + Tab.

It definitely is used when trying to build accessible components, blocking all interactions outside of it while Focus Trap is active.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	It's the responsibility of the user to add an escape method for the focus
	trap, either with a button or the escape key.
</div>

## Example

<FocusTrapExample />
