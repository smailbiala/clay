As long as the process is running, the progress bar grows continuously from 0% to 100%.

If you need to communicate the progress of a certain set of actions. You should use the [Multi Step Nav](/docs/components/multi-step-nav.html) component.

<ProgressBar />

## Status

You can use [`value`](#api-value) property to define the percentage value of the progress bar.

When [`value`](#api-value) is 100, the color of the progress bar will be styled to `success`.

Also, you can use [`warn`](#api-warn) property to set the color of the progress bar fixed on `warning`.

<ProgressBarStatus />

## Feedback

Use [`feedback`](#api-feedback) property to provide the same visual feedback to all items wrapped by `ClayProgressBar`.

<ProgressBarFeedback />
