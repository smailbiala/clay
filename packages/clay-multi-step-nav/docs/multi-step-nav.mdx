It's used when a major or big task has to be divided into smaller task, with the aim of letting the user breath in the process and providing them with a sense of progression.

Each step can have two different states: `active` or `complete` defined by props as you can see below.

## State

Each step can have two different states: `active` or `complete` defined by props as you can see below.

The active state can be set using the `active` property in the `ClayMultiStepNav.Item` or `ClayMultiStepNavWithBasicItems` component which defines the step index.

The `complete` and `error` states are defined using the `state` property in the `ClayMultiStepNav.Item` which defines whether the item is complete or has an error in the current state. The `ClayMultiStepNavWithBasicItems` component follows the same API with the difference that it sets the state of the item to the current step which is set when using the `active` or `defaultActive` API.

## Indicator position

Some use cases don't need the title or subtitle to add context to the steps, in those cases you might just want the label to be rendered to the `top` of the indicator, so it can truncate the text if it is long.

```jsx
<ClayMultiStepNav indicatorLabel="top">
	<ClayMultiStepNav.Item
		active={active}
		complete={complete}
		expand={i + 1 !== steps.length}
		key={i}
	>
		<ClayMultiStepNav.Divider />
		<ClayMultiStepNav.Indicator
			complete={complete}
			label={1 + i}
			onClick={onClick}
			subTitle={label}
		/>
	</ClayMultiStepNav.Item>
</ClayMultiStepNav>
```

## Collapsable Steps

Using `ClayMultiStepNavWithBasicItems` in combination with `maxStepsShown` prop you can collapse the steps that don't fit into a dropdown to ensure good user experience.
