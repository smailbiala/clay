In order to create a controlled `Toggle` you need to provide the `toggled` and `onToggle` props.

You can also have custom icons that further signal the current state of the Toggle by providing a `symbol` prop.

<Toggle />

## Inside ClayRadioGroup

If you want the Toggle to behave like a radio element (toggling one on will toggle others off) wrap multiple `Toggles` with a [ClayRadioGroup](/docs/components/radio-group.html) component.

<RadioToggle />
