import {DualListBox} from '$packages/clay-form/docs/duallistbox';

ClayDualListBox consists of low-level utilities that provides the ability to create a Select with multiple options selectable.
Users are allowed to multi-select different items from a list and sometimes, options in use can be re-order.
It's a high level component using `ClaySelectBox` under the hood.

> Note: The actual select functionality will not work here due to a pending issue at [FormidableLabs/react-live#196](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live/issues/196). To see it in action, check out the [storybook demo](https://storybook.clayui.com/?path=/story/design-system-components-duallistbox--default).
