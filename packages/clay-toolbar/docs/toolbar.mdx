## Introduction

A toolbar organizes actions into a horizontal bar that is responsive. Its height changes to accommodate the height of the elements it contains. The toolbar always maintains the vertical alignment.

## Composing

**ClayToolbar.Nav** is the highest level wrapper to be used inside the Toolbar to wrap all the content inside.

**ClayToolbar.Item** represents a Toolbar child item, a list item that is supposed to wrap around any of the other low-level components.

**ClayToolbar.Section** is a wrapper to be used inside the **ClayToolbar.Item** that makes the contents it wraps display inline.

**ClayToolbar.Action** is used when you want a clickable icon to add an action in the Toolbar.

**ClayToolbar.Input**, **ClayToolbar.Label** and **ClayToolbar.Link** are essentially a wrapper around their respective Clay components with some specifics related to Toolbar.
